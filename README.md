D3X is a Domain Driven Design experiment in PHP.  The whole idea being to give an initial seed and footprint for a
basic DDD project implemented in PHP.

##### Code

**Bugfixes should be sent to to current stable branch, which is the same as major version number.**
Breaking features and major improvements should be sent into `master`. When you send PRs to master, they will be added to release cycle only when the next stable branch is started.

##### Documentation

The documentation for each module is directly generated from the corresponding docblock which can be found in each module (src/Common/*).

### At a Glance

Describe what you test and how you test it. Use PHP to write descriptions faster.

Run tests and see what actions were taken and what results were seen.


### Composer

```
php composer.phar require "code-ninja-io/d3x:*"
